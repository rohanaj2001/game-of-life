# Conway's Game of Life Simulation using Pygame

This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rohanaj2001/game-of-life
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd pygame-game-of-life
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/Linux
    ```

    Or, on Windows:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install Pygame:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
